            <h2>WHO I AM 👩🏻 </h2>
            <p>
              My name is <strong>Agathe Louis</strong>, I am currently 18 years old and I was born on November 4, 2003 in Troyes. I am lucky to have a younger brother, Erwan. He is 16 years  old. I spent my childhood in the pretty town of <strong>Nancy</strong> then I moved to <strong>Marcq-en-Baroeul</strong>, near Lille. I was in college and high school at Marcq Institution. Then after my baccalaureate specializing in mathematics, physics and natural sciences, I succeed in joining <strong>IESEG</strong>. Now that you know more about me, I invite you to discover my hobbies and what it brings to me.

            <h2>🛫  TRIPS  🛬</h2>
            <p>
             Thanks to my parents, I had the opportunity to visit several different countries and <strong>discover several cultures</strong>. For example, I went to <strong>Sri Lanka</strong> for 2 weeks and it allowed me to get out of my comfort zone. So thanks to this experience, I was able to see the daily life of the inhabitants, taste new flavors and visit some magical places like <strong>the Golden Temple of Dambulla</strong>.

            <h2>🎨 ART</h2>
            <p>
             I cultivate a great passion for art in general. I really like <strong>visiting museums</strong>, or <strong>attending a performance in theater</strong>, or <strong>visiting art galleries</strong>. When I was in college I chose the cultural class option. With this option I was able to <strong>develop my interest for art</strong>. I went to Greece with my class to study ancient Greek architecture and art. I also went to Paris to see Antigone at the Comedie Francaise. All this activities are essential for me because it allows me <strong>to develop my creativity</strong>. Before moving onto the next section, here is my favorite painting : Aurore et Céphale by the french painter Pierre-Narcisse Guérin.
